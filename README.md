Digital VLSI SoC design and planning with a complete RTL to GDSII flow.The implementation uses open-source EDA tools like OpenLANE and Sky130 technology.The results of various stages of the VLSI design flow, such as synthesis, floorplanning, placement, clock tree synthesis, routing, and timing analysis are included.
